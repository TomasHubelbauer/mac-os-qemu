# macOS in Qemu

A collection of links relating installing and running macOS in Qemu.

## On Arch

https://passthroughpo.st/new-and-improved-mac-os-tutorial-part-1-the-basics/

This would require me to run Arch on real hardware, probably.
It also has Debian thingies but meh.

## On Windows

In theory all of the above should be portable to Windows?

This is the real meat: https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM

I started porting it in https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/sus-downloader
Now I am able to download macOS packages from SUS but it remains to be seen if DMG2IMG will work on Windows
or will be runnable in WSL or something like that and if the Qemu switchers in that repository will work on
Windows.
